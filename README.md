JSON-UTILS
==========

Numpy
-----
Uses [json_numpy]() for transparent ```loads``` and ```dumps``` of lists into numpy-arrayrs if the ```dtype``` is either purely int or float.

Trees
-----
Recursively read all ```.json``` files in a path and return a single ```dict```.

Lines
-----
JSON-lines or ```.jsonl``` is a powerful extension to the JSON-family.
